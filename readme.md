Tasks:
1. Natural numbers.
   Write a program that will write to console numbers from zero to the number from method arguments using while loop, each on new line:

public class NaturalNumbers {
public void naturalNumbersPrinter(int lastPrinted) {
}
}
2. Even numbers.
   Write a program that will write to console even numbers from zero to the number from method arguments using while loop, each on new line:

public class EvenNumbersPrinter {
public void printEvenNumbers(int printTillInclusive) {
}
}
3. Multiplication.
   Write a program that will write to console multiplied numbers by input from zero to the number from method arguments using while loop, each on new line(program should also be able to work with negatives):

public class Multiplication {
public void printMultiplied(int multiplyByAndToInclusive) {
}
}
4. Simple numbers.
   Write a program that will write to console all simple numbers from 0 up to input from method arguments using while loop, each on new line:

public class PrimeNumbers {
public void printPrimeNumbers(int printToInclusive) {
}
}
5. Factorial.
   Write a program that will write to console all numbers from factorial row, from 0 up to input from method arguments using while loop, each on new line:

public class FactorialNumbers {
public void printFactorialRow(int printToInclusive) {
}
}
6. Power of two.
   Write a program that will take int power as an argument. This argument will be used to calculate power of 2. The program should write to console each value for power of 2 beginning from 2^0...2^power. Write the program using "while" in case of negative value print "too much power":

public class PowerOfTwo {
public void powerOfTwo(int power){
//write your code here
}
}
7. WordsBuilder.
   Write a program that will build a phrase from given chars (char...). !HINT check length method in google!

public class WordsBuilder {
public void buildPhrase(char... chars) {
}
}
